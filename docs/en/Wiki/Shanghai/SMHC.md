# Shanghai Mental Health Centre

The quintessential psych ward in Shanghai, comprised of two campuses.

## Introduction

Shanghai Mental Health Centre is regarded the runner-up amongst all psych wards in China, with two campuses located in 3210 Huhang Rd in Minhang District, and the main campus in 600 S Yuanping Rd, in Xuhui District, as the headquarter of this teaching hospital. The Minhang Campus serves as a long-term facility, and the biggest psych ward in China.

Whilst there is an open ward in the Xuhui Headquarter, Hangxing campus solely has locked wards. Compared to NBH, SMHC is harsher when it comes to its restraint, ECT, and various policies. Even with locked wards, Hangxing campus tends to have stricter measures.

## Neurodiversity & Transgender Inclusivity

Our current evidence fails to reach a confident conclusion where transgender individuals are treated differently. 

Inpatient HRT availability is subjected to the discretion of your attending doctor. There are instances where transgender individuals are subject to stricter management, such as continuous four-point restraint for two weeks.

## Inpatient Life, Headquarter

The Headquarter has one hybrid ward, which is Ward 4. If you are hospitalised there, you may leave with the permission of your attending doctor, and with your parents / caregiver's presence.

Other wards are completely locked. The nurse station is secured with an glass door enhanced with metal structure. If you could not sleep at night, minor tranqualisers are possible but hardly given, since resident doctors tend not to care.

With the exception of Ward 1, the paediatric ward, in all wards uniform are compulsory. Uniform are provided all week, and there is a larger size for people in such need.
