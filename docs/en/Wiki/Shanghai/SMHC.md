# Shanghai Mental Health Centre

The quintessential psych ward in Shanghai, comprised of two campuses.

## Introduction

Shanghai Mental Health Centre is regarded the runner-up amongst all psych wards in China, with two campuses located in 3210 Huhang Rd in Minhang District, and the main campus in 600 S Yuanping Rd, in Xuhui District, as the headquarter of this teaching hospital. The Minhang Campus serves as a long-term facility, and the biggest psych ward in China.

Whilst there is an open ward in the Xuhui Headquarter, Hangxing campus solely has locked wards. Compared to NBH, SMHC is harsher when it comes to its restraint, ECT, and various policies. Even with locked wards, Hangxing campus tends to have stricter measures.

## Neurodiversity & Transgender Inclusivity

Our current evidence fails to reach a confident conclusion whether transgender individuals are treated differently.

Inpatient HRT availability is subjected to the discretion of your attending doctor. There are instances where transgender individuals are subject to stricter management, such as continuous four-point restraint for two weeks.

## Inpatient Life, Headquarter

The Headquarter has one hybrid ward, which is Ward 4, 13, 14. If you are hospitalised there, you may leave with the permission of your attending doctor, and with your parents / carer's presence. Hybrid ward charges higher rate about 30,000 – 40,000 CNY per month before insurance. For comparison, in regular ward, they charge about 25,000 – 28,000 CNY on first month, 15,000 – 20,000 CNY per month on subsequent months.

In the first fortnight of stay, the right to communicate [ie visitation, telephone] is not granted.

Other wards are completely locked. The nurse station is secured with a glass door enhanced with metal structure. If you could not sleep at night, minor tranquilisers are possible but hardly given, since resident doctors tend not to care.

With the exception of Ward 1, the paediatric ward, in all wards uniform are compulsory. Uniform is provided all week, and there is a larger size for people in such need. Paediatric ward still requires uniform when taken out for examinations. When taken out for examinations, most cases individuals will be restrained, unless deemed very low risk (voluntary entry, compliant).

Upon entry, there will be an NFC waistband and a written waistband. For drug issuing, the nurse will scan the NFC waistband with their PDA. It cannot be removed.

Cosmetics are locked. For Minhang Campus, personal cosmetics are forbidden, and they distribute public soap for use. In its main campus, they allow a weekly outdoor stay about 40 minutes in a locked tennis court.

Care workers had a history of sexually assaulting patient, but in isolated incident. They are mainly middle-aged males with uniform. 6:20 begins the wake-up call, and 6:30 is the mandatory wake-up time; non-compliance will result in physical pulling. Breakfast is catered in the living room [活動室], usually a bowl of congee with a piece of 腐乳 or 榨菜; two days in a given way, noodles are given. They are referred as 爛糊面 as a hallmark of their lack of deliciousness. Before doctors do the rounds, a toast will be given, or similar light piece of food. Doctors do the rounds at 8:30. In longer hospitalisation case (> 3 months), doctors tend to only change pleasantry, in shorter case they will ask simple questions.

On around 9:00, there will be rounds of occupational therapies, comprised of preliminary art therapy etc. On around 11:00, there will be lunch. Usually, there will be a dish containing meat and another vegan. There could be a bowl of soup. Care workers will clean the table. On 12:00 to 13:30, people will return to their rooms for a nap, after which they will return to the living room. There might be television, or Chinese Medicine combined therapy, which is an e-stim with needles inserted to your body. There is no reported instance where it is used as a punishment.

On 14:00, there will be calisthenics, attending is voluntary. However, almost all attendance will be reported to the attending doctor, which is determining your length of stay. On 14:30, the occupational therapy repeats. There will be 2 – 3 times of group therapy per week.

In the afternoon, doctor might show randomly for check-ups. Privilege to use pens are only given to stabilised patients.
Dinner is catered on 17:00, and after 17:30 there will be a relative freedom – you can stay in the living room (which has lower regulation now) or return to your room. Sex is not allowed in the living room.

Lights are out on 20:30 (however, there is switch in the room). A room contains usually 4-8 people on regular rooms, and two in VIP rooms.

Showering happens twice in a week during June to October, and for the rest, once a week. In Xuhui campus, two people will use a shower head at the same time in a room; in Minhang campus, there is a shower room with 8 shower heads.

On restraining, male individual are more likely not given with toilet access (that they must excrete on the bed); longest known restraint time is 3 weeks continuous, and the usual maximum is 2 weeks. Usually, during the day, person is restrained on an interrogation chair.
